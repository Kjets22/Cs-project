router interconnects links proccessing packets and moving them form one link
to another link

we tranismit data in 1 and 0 in a netowrk

amplitued modilation is a way to  encode a signal so that it can understand 
the 1s and 0s to get the encoded data
amplitued modulation is chaing the amplitued of the singals to see the 1s and 0s

frequency moduclaiton would be when you keep the amplitueud the same but you change
the frequency to that it looks diffrent frequency

phase frequency is when you send the Sin graph at a diffrente point per bit of 
infomormation it would loke like a broken/laggin sin graph

this encoding de coding happens when moving the data, each router can send diffrente
encoding of links meaning that it has to decode data and encode the data

There are diffrente types of swtiching is finding the path for the how it goes through
the routers.

Circut swtiching is where you sets up a path for the two endpoints.
	3 things needed
	Setup is to inlizaize and find the path to the endpoint
	Accpet is information that you make send data
	Data is then transmitted 
This link is then created and then no one else can you ue the link it allows for 
faster transmition as data as it makes a direct path where those routers are only
used for that one transmition of data

Message switching, which has an address for where it is going, this is called a 
header which has metadata which tells how to process the data
The message only goes through a link at a time or a node at a time, it is not allocating
space before it happens.
There is no setup set as it just send the message with the circut it does not need ot be 
set up like the circut switching.
In this case it sends the message all in one go and it all goes through the same 
routing path but there is no reserved allocation of the routers before hand
There is a Store and Foward Switching where it wait fro all of the bits to reach the 
and then then it sends it out on the next link
The internet uses store and foward delay

Packet Switching, meaning that you are make it so the packets have a maxium length 
meaning the message can be broken up into many packets
The packets can you in parrelle, and each packet carried meta data and they can take 
what every links they want too, they dont have to go the same way and there is no need to 
allocate a route as it is given a header with the adress
This aspect of eaching packet is called pipelining

If a path has been setup and inlizaized it does not need a header as the router is only going
to that one place as it has been inlizaed, but if it has not been inlizaed it needs a header to
know where the final desation is and where it is going.

The internet uses store and forward packet switching meaning that it waits for the whole
packet to be recived before it puts it on a new links
