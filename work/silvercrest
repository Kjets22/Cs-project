Today i am have learned about vector embeeding what i am thinking can happen is i will embeed all the meta data
 into a embeedding, then before i ask the chat bot to go and createa query i will run the emmbeddings into the 
 bot allowing for a the both to get the data it needs in the prompt and hopfully make it less token but also
 faster and more efficent
Another thing i was thinking is what happens if i give the emmbeddings into chat itself what happens then, i
 will look into this becayuse one thing i work about is the computational power of the computers that will
 be running the bot and if they dont have the computational power requried it will slow down the bot a 
 signicant amount that i was i think was happening in abhesheiks use case, i feel like his machine was the 
 thing that was slowing him down, though i have to look through the embbedings and see exactly.
Though i feel like i am getting way to ahead of my self irght now, fir i shoudl start with is creating the 
 metadata for the databse, along with that i should countine to thest the bot and try to figure out how to 
 make it as accurate as possible and not care abotu speed for right now


When i am to talk to dean, i am nothign that it consitantly look like abheseik is hiding ifroamtion from use 
 trying to give as little infromation as possible, and if this is not the case then it means that he has 
 put it very little effort in acutaly trying to improve the bot, as through my reseach these are the only 
 ways one can improve the accuray and efficney of the bot.
