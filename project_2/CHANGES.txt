As of 2024/09/30, some changes were made from the original
specification (released on 2024/09/25) to simplify the project
design.

1. The action of the RS during recursive resolution is changed. For
responses received from a TS, the flags must be changed to `ra` if the
response is authoritative.

2. TS should behave exactly the same way regardless of whether a
request arrives from the RS or the client.

3. To simplify the server and client design, all servers listen on a
single fixed port. This also simplifies the command line used to
invoke all the programs. 

4. Using the same listening port for all three server programs means
that no two servers can run on the same machine. Your project code
must function correctly when the three servers are run on distinct
machines (with the same port specified in the command line).

5. The sample input and output files were modified to adhere to the
new RS and TS behaviors.
